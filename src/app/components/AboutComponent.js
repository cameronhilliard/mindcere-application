        <p className='text-xl/10 text-center'>I created MindCere out of a deep curiosity about brain health, sparked by my own experience with a seizure. This journey is not just about understanding the brainâ€”it's about exploring ways to strengthen and protect it. Through MindCere, I aim to uncover insights that could help not only me but others who may be looking for ways to support cognitive well-being and possibly prevent provoked seizures.</p>
